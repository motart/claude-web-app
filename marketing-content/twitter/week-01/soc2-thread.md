## Tweet 1 (Hook)
🔒 BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: OrderNimbus is now SOC 2 Type II compliant! 

Here's why this matters for enterprise retailers (and what it took to get here) 🧵👇

## Tweet 2 (Problem)
Most AI forecasting tools treat security as an afterthought. Enterprise retailers need:
- Data encryption at rest & in transit
- Audit trails for compliance teams
- Role-based access controls
- 99.9% uptime SLAs

## Tweet 3 (Solution Part 1)
SOC 2 Type II covers 5 trust service principles:
🛡️ Security - Multi-factor auth, encryption, monitoring
📈 Availability - 99.9% uptime, disaster recovery
✅ Processing Integrity - Data validation, error handling

## Tweet 4 (Solution Part 2)
🔐 Confidentiality - Data classification, access restrictions
🛡️ Privacy - GDPR-ready controls, consent management

All independently audited over 12+ months. Not just a checkbox—real security.

## Tweet 5 (Technical Details)
Under the hood:
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- TLS 1.3 for all data transit
- HMAC request signing
- 7-year audit log retention
- Zero-trust architecture

Built for enterprise from day one.

## Tweet 6 (Business Impact)
This means enterprise retailers can now:
✅ Pass vendor security reviews
✅ Meet compliance requirements
✅ Satisfy auditor demands
✅ Deploy with confidence

No more "we'll evaluate security later"

## Tweet 7 (Customer Validation)
"SOC 2 compliance was non-negotiable for us. OrderNimbus was the only AI forecasting platform that could pass our security review on day one." 

- Sarah Chen, COO @ MidAtlantic Home Goods

## Tweet 8 (Industry Context)
