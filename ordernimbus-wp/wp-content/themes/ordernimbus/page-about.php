                    <p>To transform retail operations through enterprise-grade AI forecasting that combines accuracy, security, and scalability.</p>
                    <p>Founded by retail technology veterans, OrderNimbus was built to solve the fundamental challenges that enterprise retailers face with inventory forecasting and demand planning.</p>

                    <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                    <p>73% of retailers struggle with inventory forecasting, leading to $1.1T in excess inventory globally and $634B in lost sales from stockouts.</p>
                    <p>Traditional solutions are either too expensive ($500K+), too complex (12-month implementations), or lack the security and compliance requirements that enterprise retailers demand.</p>
